# Mosaic-Pharmacy
In this project, I have Customized the Parallax Pro theme with custom post types, taxonomies, image sizes, and Google Fonts integration. Enhanced performance by limiting revisions, and streamlining the homepage. Used advanced jQuery to reorder elements, add buttons, toggle classes, and improve UI/UX with responsive adjustments.
